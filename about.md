Hello there! I'm Jakub Nierostek, a student immersing myself in the realms of computer science and physical chemistry. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in computer science at the Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU), and I also hold a master's degree in physical chemistry from Charles University (CUNI). During my master's, I successfully predicted chemical toxicity using deep learning, thus fusing my passion for both chemistry and computers.

But why this blog? I view writing as a potent tool for clarifying my thoughts. And, what's the blog about? It revolves around topics that captivate my interest. Beyond my studies, I derive immense pleasure from the world of classical music. To maintain a clear mind and a healthy body, I enjoy running, occasional hiking, and biking. My other interests encompass natural sciences (chemistry, programming), as well as reading anything from the realm of fantasy, politics and philosophy of religion.
