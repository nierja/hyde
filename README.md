This webpage was built using [Hyde](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/hyde), a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

Hosting is done via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Following extensions and modifications were employed alongside the original [Hyde](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/hyde) template:
* Added [MathJax](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~zichen2/blog/coding/setup/2019/02/17/how-to-add-mathjax-support-to-jekyll.html) support for rendering LaTeX
* Added [Google Analytics](https://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/) to understand incomming web traffic
