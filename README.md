This webpage was built using [Hyde](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/hyde), a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. Based on the elegant [Poole](http://getpoole.com) framework, the Jekyll butler.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The Hyde theme ensures that the content looks great across all devices and screen sizes.

- **Sidebar Focus:** The prominent sidebar provides quick access to key sections while keeping the content clean and clutter-free.

- **Easy Customization:** Hyde allows for easy personalization and apperarance customization.

## Hosting

The blog is hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), ensuring fast load times and reliable performance.

## Extensions and Enhancements

In addition to the core Hyde theme, I've integrated the following extensions and modifications to enhance the functionality and user experience:

1. **MathJax Support:** Complex mathematical equations are rendered seamlessly using [MathJax](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~zichen2/blog/coding/setup/2019/02/17/how-to-add-mathjax-support-to-jekyll.html), allowing for the inclusion of LaTeX equations and formulas.

2. **Google Analytics:** To gain valuable insights into incoming web traffic and visitor behavior, I've integrated [Google Analytics](https://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/).
